  # Stress Buster Flow

  This flow assists in stress management by providing personalized coping mechanisms and suggestions.

  **How it works:**

  1. **Describe your stress:** Input the reason for your stress or anxiety in detail. 

  2. **Receive personalized guidance:** The flow will use an LLM to:
     * Identify potential causes of your stress.
     * Suggest calming techniques (e.g., deep breathing, mindfulness).
     * Provide practical coping mechanisms (e.g., exercise, spending time in nature).
     * Offer advice on how to reframe your thoughts or approach the challenge.
     * Suggest actions you can take to address the underlying cause of your stress.

  **Example Input:**

  > I haven't studied for my upcoming exams and I'm feeling overwhelmed.

  **Disclaimer:**

  * The quality of the response will depend on the complexity of the query and the capabilities of the LLM. 
  * The LLM may not always provide accurate or complete information. 
  * It is essential to verify the information provided by the LLM with reliable sources.
