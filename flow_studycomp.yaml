  This flow assists students with their studies and homework. 

  **How it works:**

  1. **Select your class/level:** Specify your current academic level (e.g., "Class 10," "Grade 8," "Undergraduate").
  2. **Choose topic:** Select the subject or topic you are studying (e.g., "Science," "English Literature," "Calculus").
  3. **Ask your doubt/query:** Enter the specific question or concept you don't understand.
  4. **(Optional) Desired length of answer:** Specify whether you prefer a short or detailed explanation.

  The flow will then use an LLM to:
    * Explain the concept in the requested detail.
    * Provide relevant examples to illustrate the concept.
    * Generate a few practice problems to help you understand and apply the concept.

  **Disclaimer:**

  * The quality of the response will depend on the complexity of the query and the capabilities of the LLM. 
  * The LLM may not always provide accurate or complete information. 
  * It is essential to verify the information provided by the LLM with reliable sources.
